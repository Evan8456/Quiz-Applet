,What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?


,A.An abstract class is a class that may or may not have abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated 
and the cannot be sub-classed. An interface is a reference type. Similar to a class that can contain only constants 
and/or method signatures. There are no method bodies. Interfaces cannot be instantiated. They can only be implemented 
by classes or extended by other interfaces.
,B.An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract. it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract 
classes cannot be instantiated. But they can be sub-classed. The subclass usually provides implementations for all of 
the abstract methods in its parent class. However if it does not; the subclass must also be declared abstract. An 
interface is a special kind of abstract class that can contain only class constants and method signatures. There are 
no method bodies allowed in methods in an interface. Interfaces cannot be instantiated. They can only be implemented 
by classes or extended by other interfaces.
,C.An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract. Abstract classes can be instantiated. But they cannot be 
sub-classed. An interface is a class that can contain only method bodies. Interfaces can be instantiated. But they 
cannot be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
,D.There are no differences between an abstract class and an interface. They are both classes that can have abstract 
and non-abstract methods and there are no method bodies. Neither of them can be instantiated. But they can be 
sub-classed.
,E.An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract. It may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes
cannot be instantiated. But they can be sub-classed. The subclass usually provides implementations for all of the 
abstract methods in its parent class. However if it does not; the subclass must also be declared abstract. An 
interface is is class that has method bodies.

,A: p = cw;
,B: cw = new Puzzle();
,C:  p = new Crossword(10  20);// there is a coma where the space is.
,D: Solvable x = new Crossword(10  20); //there is a coma where the space is.

, Suppose all valid five-digit zip codes are represented as Integer objects and stored in a set containing about 4000 zip codes. Compare two implementations of this set: one is a HashSet with 400 buckets; another is a TreeSet. 
Assume that various zip codes are matched against the set with roughly the same frequency. Which of the following statements about the average performance of these implementations is true?

,A : HashSet works more than 100 times faster than TreeSet
,B : HashSet works about 20 times faster than TreeSet
,C : HashSet works 2-4 times faster than TreeSet
,D:  HashSet works slower than TreeSet
,E:  HashSet works roughly as fast as TreeSet. It also takes more than twice as much space
