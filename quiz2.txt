,Consider the code 
int[] x = {5 6 7 8 9};//Assume actual code has commas separating input instead of spaces

,Consider the following piece of code: 
int i; 
for(i=0; i<10; i++){ 
/* some code that doesn't modify i */ 


} 
System.out.println("i="+i); /* line A */ 


What is printed by the statement on line A?

,A.i=0
,B.i=9
,C.i=10
,D.i=11
,E.This piece of code doesn't compile since the scope of i is limited to the for loop.
